To evaluate my locomotion & interaction technique a user study was conducted including 2 participants and myself. The participants were exposed to the parkour for around 15-20 minutes with 5 minutes of practice beforehand. The instructions given to the participants were to be as fast and accurated as possible. After each round the time was collected. The following variables were measured and collected during the user study:

- Average time per round
- Average accuracy per round

|  | Participant 1 | Participant 2 | Me |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Average round | 1058.2 | 978.4 | 859.9 |
| Average accuracy | 0.67 | 0.64 | 0.80 |

## Questionnaire

After testing the parkour, the participants were interviewed with the following questionaire at hand to measure their experience with the locomotion & interaction technique: 

- Simulator Sickness using the following single item question:
“On a scale from 1 to 10, how much motion sickness do you perceive right now” (1 lowest 10 highest)
- Presence using the following single item question:
“On a scale from 1 to 10 how present did you feel in the virtual world” (1 lowest 10 highest)
- Enjoyment using:
“On a scale from 1 to 10, how much fun did you have during the task ” (1 lowest 10 highest)
- Fatigue using:
“On a scale from 1 to 10, how fatigued were you during the task ” (1 lowest 10 highest)

Here are the questionaire results:

## Feedback

The participants were also asked to give feedback after the testing phase: 

- If you get the dribble motion down it works nice but the involuntary movements are negative
- Dunking was fun but the fact that it still has a lot of bugs makes it not fun in general
- A lot of cybersickness when spamming the dunking motion
- Dribbling is not cybersickness inducing at all
- Haptics and sound effects are good and make the whole experience more realistic
- Interaction task: A visual feedback for how strong the spin currently is would be nice

## Conclusion

To conclude the user study there were interesting insights that I gained from doing this user study. One of the learnings was that the learning curve was quiet high at the beginning due to some newly found bugs like the “superman move” where the ball gets stuck in your arm/controller and you can extend your arm in front to move just like superman. But when the participants got the motion and timing down, it was quiet natural & easy to move around for them. That was interesting because as the developer you usually have this tunnel vision because you exactly know how your code behaves and you will act accordingly. Another interesting observation was that the participants will use the most convenient or fun way to move around the parkour. F.e. participant 2 decided to dunk his way to the goal line (even though it affected his coin collecting negatively) in one round because the dribbling motion was too slow for him. Also fatigue was no problem at all during the testing phase, so it probably has to be measured for a longer period of time to evaluate the tiring effects of the dribbling/dunking motion. Personally i think it has to do with the weight of the controller because IRL the basketball is heavier and also the amount of force you apply on the basketball while dribbling is also a crucial factor, which can be hardly simulated with the VR-controllers.
