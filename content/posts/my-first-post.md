## Introduction

This blog documents the semester-long project for the course “Interaction in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality” at TU Darmstadt. The task for the course was to dive into VR-Development with Unity and create a locomotion technique and an object interaction technique, which will be used to move through a VR-Parkour that was developed by one of the lecturers. We were also given Meta Quest 2 headsets, where we could develop and test our applications on.

## The Idea in a nutshell

Since it was my first time developing in VR and only my second time using an VR-headset (first time was a rather cybersickness inducing stationary rollercaster simulator at gamescom 2014), I was curious how a movement based motion like you have in basketball would translate in Virtual Reality and if it could spark the same sense of excitement that you get from playing “real” basketball. At first I played around with the headset and tried out different sorts of VR-Apps and ended up finding an Basketball Game with the name of “Gymclass”. The locomotion is simple and uses the joysticks of the controller to move around, which was really cybersickness inducing for me.

So I decided to create a locomotion technique based around the well-known movements of basketball like dribbling, crossover and dunking. For the object interaction technique I wanted to stick to the basketball narrative, thus I  used a spinning basketball as a metaphor to rotate the given T-Shape in the parkour at hand.
