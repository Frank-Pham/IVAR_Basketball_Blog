One of the learnings was that the learning curve was quiet high at the beginning due to some newly found bugs like the “superman move” where the ball gets stuck in your arm/controller and you can extend your arm in front to move just like superman. But when the participants got the motion and timing down, it was quiet natural \u0026 easy to move around for them. That was interesting because as the developer you usually have this tunnel vision because you exactly know how your code behaves and you will act accordingly. Another interesting observation was that the participants will use the most convenient or fun way to move around the parkour. F.e. participant 2 decided to dunk his way to the goal line (even though it affected his coin collecting negatively) in one round because the dribbling motion was too slow for him. Also fatigue was no problem at all during the testing phase, so it probably has to be measured for a longer period of time to evaluate the tiring effects of the dribbling/dunking motion. Personally i think it has to do with the weight of the controller because IRL the basketball is heavier and also the amount of force you apply on the basketball while dribbling is also a crucial factor, which can be hardly simulated with the VR-controllers.\n",

<p>After testing the parkour, the participants were interviewed with the following questionaire at hand to measure their experience with the locomotion &amp; interaction technique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simulator Sickness using the following single item question:
“On a scale from 1 to 10, how much motion sickness do you perceive right now” (1 lowest 10 highest)</li>
<li>Presence using the following single item question:
“On a scale from 1 to 10 how present did you feel in the virtual world” (1 lowest 10 highest)</li>
<li>Enjoyment using:
“On a scale from 1 to 10, how much fun did you have during the task ” (1 lowest 10 highest)</li>
<li>Fatigue using:
“On a scale from 1 to 10, how fatigued were you during the task ” (1 lowest 10 highest)</li>

<p>Here are the questionaire results:</p>
